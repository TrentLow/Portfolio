              <p><img src="" height="400" width="400" alt="" class="img-thumbnail" title=""/></a><br>Hello, my name is Trent Lowery. I just started coding recently, I had gained the intrest from a good friend and have ever since been doing the grind to make this intrest into a career path. I have gained the greatest portion of my knowledge from
                  <a href="www.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a>, and my good friend. I have a very short learning curve, and I plan on growing my knowledge as far as time will let me. I feel like my HTML and CSS are up to par, my Javascript is basic knowledge
                  but I am continuing to master my craft. Please take a look at my projects! If you have any tips, suggestions or questions do not hesitate to ask! Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio!
